- **By entering a user's GitHub username into the "Github Profile Finder" search box, you can find that user's profile information as well as links to their most recent 5 repositories. Every time you type something, the application will send a request to the GitHub API to search for the username you just typed, and any users who match the query will have their information displayed. If the user cannot be located, a warning message will appear and vanish after 3000 seconds. The profile information will include the user's avatar, a link to his GitHub profile, and other information about him like his company. The most recent five repositories will be shown, along with a link to the repository and other pertinent information like the number of stars, forks, and language.**

  **The Github Profile Finder is a small, open-source project that makes it easy for you to discover other GitHub users based on their GitHub username. Simply type your GitHub username into the search box, and you'll be presented with information about the user you searched for and numerous links to his or her most recent projects**.
